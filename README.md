# React CV/Resume Application

A CV/resume builder app. You can use it to build your resume and print it out.

It is built with **React** and I initially used *class components*, but later refactored them into *functional components*.

You can add additional sections in the 'Education' and 'Experience parts by clicking 'Add' and you can edit any section that is already saved by clicking 'Edit'.

This app represents only the general concept by incorporating the most basic sections and could be expanded upon in the future. I would definitely also add a separate CSS sheet for printing, which would omit the buttons.
